    <h2>Christin Swayze</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Christin Swayze. Currently, I live in Arizona with my husband, Ken (not Patrick). He and I were both born and raised in
        Oregon, but when we were looking for somewhere to retire to we bought proerty in Eastern Arizona. We were able to find jobs in Phoenix so we spend
        our week days in Phoenix and we are on our proerty in Concho every weekend. We have five kids, and currently have five grandchildren. That might or
        might not be changing soon, though.</p>
    <p>My husband and I love to travel and visit new places. The image above is one he took of me in Tombstone a couple of weeks ago. He was working out of
        Bisbee so I went down over the weekend and we explored Bisbee and Tombstone, Arizona. Other things that I like to do are family history, reading,
        spending time with my family, crafting, or anything that has to do with water.</p>
    <p>When I decided to do the pathways program a few years ago, I wanted to study family history. I have been doing that but as my third certificate I decided
        on web design. I am going to be starting a business where I do accounting work and also family history. With that, I want to be able to design my
        own web page possibly. I say possibly because one of my sons is in marketing and has told me he will design my website. But even if he does, I believe
        that having the understanding of how to make changes or do it myself is a good thing. What I want to get out of this class is just a further
        understanding of this new language I am learning.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for most of my life. I went to church before I was eight, and then my family did
        not attend for a few years. However, at thirteen I was baptized and I have been a member ever since. That does not mean I always attended like I should
        have, but I have never lost my testimony. I am currently serving as 1st counselor in the Relief Society in the Concho Ward. And my husband is 1st counselor
        in the Bishopric. That makes us very busy at times.</p>
    <p>I look forward to being in this class with you all and learning about you as we work on our different web pages!</p>
