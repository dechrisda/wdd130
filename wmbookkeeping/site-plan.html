      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>
        Bookkeeping and Accounting Services
        The services White Mountain Bookkeeping (WMB) provides include bookkeeping and tax preparation. For bookkeeping and accounting purposes there will be weekly, monthly, and quarterly services available. I will also be able to work directly with your tax preparer if you would prefer to keep bookkeeping and tax services separate. Services include payroll, sales tax, adding and categorizing financial transactions, financial statements, bank/loan/credit card reconciliation, workers compensation audits, accounts payable and accounts receivables, and tax projections. For start-ups I can assist with new Quickbooks set up, provide Quickbooks training, and give guidance on record keeping for tax preparation purposes. If you have fallen behind in your accounting, we can help with that too. We can complete basic bookkeeping for previous months or even years to help you get back on track. Then financial statements can be issued to help get those tax returns filed. Whatever services you are in need of, we can help you through support and genuine interest in helping you to grow your business.
        Tax Preparation Services
        For tax preparation, individual tax preparation is the core specialty. We have over 15 years of experience preparing and filing returns electronically, including clients that have investments, rentals, and small businesses. No matter what kind of small business you have, including C Corporations, S Corporations, Limited Liability Corporations, Partnerships, and Sole Proprietor we can help prepare the tax return to help minimize the tax owed. Federal and State tax returns have been prepared for restaurants, contractors, truck drivers, daycares, online retailers, and much more. 
        In Person or Virtually
        If you are in the White Mountain area of Arizona, services could be conducted at your place of business. However, much of the bookkeeping and tax preparation could be done virtually and sent to you through email or other safe portals. Call today for your free consultation.
