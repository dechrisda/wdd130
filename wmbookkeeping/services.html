                <h2>Bookkeeping and Accounting Services</h2>
                <p>The services White Mountain Bookkeeping (WMB) provides include bookkeeping and tax preparation. For bookkeeping and 
                    accounting purposes there will be weekly, monthly, and quarterly services available. I will also be able to work directly 
                    with your tax preparer if you would prefer to keep bookkeeping and tax services separate. Services include:<br>
                    Payroll, sales tax, adding and categorizing financial transactions, financial statements, bank/loan/credit card reconciliation,
                    workers compensation audits, accounts payable and accounts receivables, and tax projections.<br> 
                    For start-ups I can assist with new QuickBooks set up, provide QuickBooks training, and give guidance on record keeping 
                    for tax preparation purposes.<br>
                    If you have fallen behind in your accounting, we can help with that too. We can complete basic bookkeeping for previous 
                    months or even years to help you get back on track. Then financial statements can be issued to help get those tax returns filed.<br>
                    Whatever services you are in need of, we can help you through support and genuine interest in helping you to grow your business.</p>
